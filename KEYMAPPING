KEY MAP FILE - DOCUMENTATION ONLY!

The code doesn't necessarily DO this, but this is how I intend to lay out the framebuffer-mode keyboard.
The idea is to try getting PC key labels at least close to their Explorer equivalents, not trying to match
the original Explorer keyboard layout (because myself and I bet most other emulator users haven't ever seen
or used the original Explorer keyboard)

In framebuffer mode I may be able to use the stupid "internet" keys on "modern" keyboards for things, but I don't
know if that's the case with SDL.
